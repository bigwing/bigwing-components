## Unreleased

## 2.6.0 (2019-08-29)

### Bug Fix

- When there is no `options.version` param provided `deprecated` method warns with more relaxed tone.

## 2.0.4 (2019-01-03)

## 2.0.0 (2018-09-05)

### Breaking Change

- Change how required built-ins are polyfilled with Babel 7 ([#9171](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9171)).  If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods.

### New Feature

- Call `doAction` hook when a deprecated feature is encountered ([#8110](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8110))
